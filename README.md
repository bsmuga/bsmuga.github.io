# Technical Basics

This is my personal technical blog where I document my explorations of interesting technical topics. Here I share my notes, insights, and thoughts from deep dives into papers, books, and technical concepts that fascinate me. I just want to motivate myself to put them down 😄

## What you'll find here

- **Technical analysis** of foundational papers like "Attention Is All You Need"
- **Book explorations** covering works like "Crafting Interpreters" 
- **Mathematical details** and implementation insights often overlooked in typical tutorials
- **Weekend coding experiments** with accompanying repositories
- **Learning notes** from my journey through complex technical concepts

## Philosophy

These posts represent concept exploration combined with hands-on experimentation and implementation that will be placed in the separate repositories.

## Live site

The blog is hosted at: [https://bsmuga.github.io/](https://bsmuga.github.io/)
The blog format was copied with help of AI from [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/) which itself is really interesting blog.
